# tic_tac_toe
**a command line tic_tac_toe written in ruby**

I'm not proud of what this is atm

## What mistakes i made
- so many mistakes
- nested methods at the start
- only one class
- not properly understanding what my instance methods take as arguments and do with them
- ⚠️ **NOT** writing DRY code
- not taking the time to *properly* debug and just looking through code hoping i find the problem
- coding in the middle of the night
- not taking even a single break for 4 hours, only to realise that i havent eaten yet


## What I realised from making this
- the importance of at least semi structured code
- how helpful and unhelpful pseudocode is
- why understanding the changes you make to your code is very useful
- that i wasn't capable of immediatly implementing what i learned and definitly need more practice
- coding while tired and mentally drained does infact not improve productivity

## What I will do differently for the next project (Mastermind)
- make more and smaller classes
- make each class do very specific things
- try to pass relevant data along linearly
- don't spend too much time planning
- do it at day time and take regular breaks
